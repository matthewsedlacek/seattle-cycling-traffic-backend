# üö¥üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seattle Bike Traffic - Backend üö¥üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

An app that provides historical data and the ability to comment on Seattle's bike trails.
The City of Seattle collects bike counter data at 10 locations. We wanted to utilize the Seattle bike-share data to show users how many cyclists are using these routes.
This [link](https://github.com/johnrusch/seattle-cycling-traffic-frontend) will direct you to the frontend repository.

## Motivation

The Seattle Cycling Trafic application was created to provide cyclists with a consolidated view of trail options and bicycle traffic patterns. The application empowers users to make informed decisions about which bike trail is best for them and the times to ride.

2. Run `bundle install` in terminal
3. Run the backend server - using rails server
